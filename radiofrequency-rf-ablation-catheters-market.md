<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency (RF) Ablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Irrigated</li><li>Non-irrigated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radiofrequency (RF) Ablation Catheters market is primarily segmented into two types: irrigated and non-irrigated catheters. Irrigated catheters continually supply a saline solution to cool the tip during the ablation process, enhancing tissue precision and minimizing damage to surrounding areas. Non-irrigated catheters, on the other hand, rely solely on heat generation for tissue destruction without additional cooling, making them simpler but potentially less precise. Both types serve crucial roles in treating various cardiac conditions and other medical applications.</p></p>
